# This is entirely incomplete, still a WIP

# SurPyval

SurPyval is a strongly opinionated survival analysis library.  It has beliefs about the best way to conduct statistical analysis, and tries to make it as easy as possible for the user to do the right thing and as hard as possible to do the wrong thing.  

## Core beliefs:

* The best way to approach modelling is to start simple and build in complexity as required
* Model stacking and averaging is a _good thing_
* We should be continually checking models and results for robustness
* Bayesian and frequentist models are better together

## Things which actually work:

### Exponential:

* ML fitting
* Bayesian conjugate fitting
* ML exponential regression
